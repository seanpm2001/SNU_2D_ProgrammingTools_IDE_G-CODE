(For: SNU/2D/ProgrammingTools/IDE/G-CODE )
(About: )
(I decided to make G-CODE the main project language file for this project (SNU / 2D / Programming Tools / IDE / G-CODE) as this is a G-CODE IDE, and it needs its main language to be represented here.. )
(File info)
(File type: G-CODE source file (*.gcode) )
(File version: 1 (2022, Tuesday, September 20th at 8:46 pm PST) )

M3
(Header end.)
THIS IS NOT A VALID G-CODE FILE. PLEASE DO NOT RUN IT AND EXPECT FUNCTIONALITY. I hope that this line outside the header just prints output to the console of the program it was opened in.
